4.    - 14:00-15:00 **Prof. Huan-Yu Ku**, Department of Physics, National Taiwan Normal University (9/28) Topic: *Quantum Amplifiers:
Classification, Manipulation, Distillation, and
Application of Quantum Steerability*
      - **Abstract**
        Quantum amplifiers can be seen as a way to distill quantum correlation. In this talk, I will introduce many examples of quantum amplifiers including teleportation and Bell nonlocality. Then I will introduce my recent results of quantum amplifiers on quantum steerability in which we show that the quantum amplifier for quantum steering can always be determined. Moreover, the quantum amplifier can be determined by measurement incompatibility. I will also present some concrete examples of applying quantum amplifiers to quantum steering.
